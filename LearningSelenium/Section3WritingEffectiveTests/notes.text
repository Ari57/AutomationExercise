Page object pattern:
• Involves creating a class for each page in the app

Each page has:
• Test Selectors
• Test Methods

Goals:
• Separation of test and code
• More maintainable test code
--------------------------------
Test Suite Organisation:
• Make sure each class focuses on one area of the application
• Group tests into sub-suites based on features
• Document tests with the use of a README
